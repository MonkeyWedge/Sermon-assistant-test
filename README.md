# Sermon Companion

**Live Sermon Assistant for Neurodivergent Worshipers**

This is a personal support tool designed to help individuals with ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, and auditory processing disorder engage more deeply with live sermons. The app listens in real-time, transcribes what it hears, and offers instant, accessible support — like summaries, verse explanations, simplified language, or spiritual reflections — all without switching apps or needing to type.

- One-tap support prompts:
  - Summarize
  - Explain

  - Focus Anchor
- Designed for mobile (PWA-ready)

## Who It’s For

- People who struggle with focus, comprehension, or information overload during sermons
